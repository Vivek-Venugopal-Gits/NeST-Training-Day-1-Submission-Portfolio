        <p>One of my key projects is a GAN-Based Medical Image Enhancement System using Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN), developed as a web application with the Django framework. This project focuses on enhancing low-resolution X-ray images by improving contrast and reducing noise while maintaining medical image integrity. Special emphasis was placed on privacy by avoiding permanent storage of uploaded images and by providing a comparison module to analyze input and output image quality. This project strengthened my understanding of deep learning architectures, loss functions, and real-world constraints in healthcare AI applications.</p>

        <p>Another major project I am working on is Smart Specs for the Visually Impaired, a wearable assistive solution that integrates an attachable camera, microphone, and wireless audio with AI-driven features. The system performs real-time vision processing, traffic signal detection, facial recognition, and voice-based navigation to help visually impaired users interact more independently with their surroundings. This project combines computer vision, audio processing, and human-centered design, pushing me to think beyond algorithms and focus on accessibility, usability, and ethical responsibility.</p>

        <p>In addition, I have developed several software and web-based projects such as V.I.B.E (Vivek’s Interactive Bot for Engagement), a Python-based chatbot integrated into a Django-backed portfolio, and a Slot Machine Game using PySide6, which includes voice input, text-to-speech interaction, and controlled betting logic. I have also built a Live Speech-to-Text and Summarization System for video sessions and a Flask-based Image Framing Web App that allows users to customize and download framed images. These projects collectively enhanced my skills in full-stack development, UI design, system integration, and building complete, user-ready applications.</p>
